# Steamroller

Steamroller is a free and open-source Android utility designed to help you gain back control of your
time. It locks you out of the apps that distract you and take your time away.

## Contributing

While I haven't planned for sharing the work on this app (it is mostly open source for transparency,
given the delicate APIs it uses!), you can feel free to report bugs (please do!) or suggest new
features either via email (see below) or using GitHub issues.

## Troubleshooting & Contacts

Something went wrong? Please, please, please let me know! You can shoot me an email here:

and say hi! If you like the app and would like to support me and its development, you can do so
by [chipping in here](https://damix.me/donate). Thank you!
